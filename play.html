        <p class="speach">Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>

        <h4 class="head2">PHIPPS.</h4>  
        <p class="speach">Yes, my lord.  <span id="speach-di">[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</span></p>

        <h4 class="head1">LORD GORING. </h4> 
        <p>Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>

        <h4 class="head2">PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

        <h4 class="head1">LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p><span id="speach-di">[_Taking out old buttonhole_.]</span>  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>

        <h4 class="head2">PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

        <h4 class="head1">LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

        <h4 class="head2">PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

        <h4 class="head1">LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p><span id="speach-di">[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</span>n  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.</p>
