    <h3>ACT III.  _The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_.</h3>
    <p style="white-space: pre">
        LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]

        LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.

        LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.
