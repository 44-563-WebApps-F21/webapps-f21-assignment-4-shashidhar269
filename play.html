        <h4>LORD GORING.</h4>
        <p>Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>

        <h4>PHIPPS.</h4>  
        <p>nYes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        <p>presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p></p>

        <h4>LORD GORING. </h4> 
        <p>Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>

        <h4>PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

        <h4>LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p><p>[_Taking out old buttonhole_.]</p>  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>

        <h4>PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

        <h4>LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

        <h4>PHIPPS.</h4> 
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

        <h4>LORD GORING.</h4>  
        <p><p>[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p>n  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.</p>
